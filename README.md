# IPVanish
Updated IPVanish.Com Script

The linux script recomended by IPVanish.Com only supports start and stop.

I added "status" so you can check the current ip information/geolocation.
Information/geolocation also runs when trying to start IPVanish with a VPN already running and when stopping a VPN.
